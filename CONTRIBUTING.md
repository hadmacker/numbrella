## Guidelines

This application is intended to be a **safe space** for all users. As such, the following is a non-comprehensive, non-binding list of guidelines that shape the design of this platform.

1. This application should not use any  polarizing words or those that may be associated to aggressive undertones, religion, politics, discrimination of any sort, sensuality & sexuality, or content that may be deemed restricted, offensive, or not appropriate to any group of users.
2. Avoid word groups that have multiple meanings. "Admit", for example, has several meanings and may be confusing to users lacking a mastery of the English language.
3. Use "short" words when possible. While a word length is not specifically defined here, prefer short words that are easy for young users to read.
4. Avoid words using complex or silent letters when easier words are available. Users without a strong understanding of the English language may struggle with complex word patterns.
5. This is a "captive" site. There should be no links to the outside world or that exit this site.
6. Consistency is preferred. This fosters a sense of common understanding between activities in the platform.
